# WordJumbleHaskell
This project demonstrates how a simple word-game can be developed using Haskell. Initially, we get an empty grid and five letters of a meaningful word jumbled in a random order on top of the grid. The task is to arrange the letters in the proper order in the grid in order to form the meaningful word. The letters are fed into ‘mouse-click’ in the form of a ‘queue’ and with every click on the grid, the letters are printed from left to right. So if the letters are ‘e-p-a-l-p’, then order to click in the grid is ‘5-2-1-4-3’ to form ‘a-p-p-l-e’.
